# Learn Kubernetes

## What is K8s ?

It is a popular container orchestrator tool.

## Why do you need K8s and what problem does it solves ?

Trends of micro services has increased the usage of containers and to handle these containers efficiently, need an 
orchestrator tool like k8s. Orchestration tool helps in automating the deployment, managing, scaling, and networking of containers, 
elf healing, high availability and Automated rollouts and rollbacks.

* Kubernetes - The whole orchestration system

### Control plane / Master node

* **kube-apiserver** - It's an entry point to interact with Kubernetes API (acts as a gateway). It determines if a request is valid 
and, if it is, processes it. It can be accessed through the kubectl cmd or kubeadm.

* **kube-scheduler** - It considers the resource needs of a pod, such as CPU or memory, along with the health of the cluster. Then it 
schedules the pod to an appropriate compute node. Then it passes on the requests to kubelet to execute it.

* **kube-controller-manager** - Detects state changes in the cluster (eg: if pod crashes, detects it and recovers the cluster state). 
Checks with scheduler and makes sure the correct number of pods is running.

* **etcd** - It is a key-value store database, stores the cluster state. All of the cluster information (eg: new pod created, pod 
crashed) is stored in the etcd.

### Compute machine / Worker node

* **kubelet** - Kubernetes agent running on nodes, a tiny application that communicates with the control plane & containers vice versa
and when the control plane needs something to happen in a node, the kubelet executes the action. It ensures the containers are 
running in the pod.

* **kube-proxy** - The kube-proxy handles network communications inside or outside of your cluster. It uses operating systemâ€™s packet 
filtering layer if there is one, otherwise , kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself.

* **container runtime** - It is the software responsible for running containers. It can be Docker, Containerd and CRI-O.
